A responsive single page AngularJS contacts / address book social search app/widget 

Has browse, search, navigate, and sort functionality using JSON data and Bootstrap 3.

Still being developed.  Adding routes and more views.

Can be used as a standalone application or an add-on module/component to an existing AngularJS app.

This is really meant to be used as more of a boilerplate to whatever you want to create.  Save yourself some time.  Use your imagination. Give me credit though.
